## [Installation](#installation)

I started by creating a new repo on GitHub giving it a unique name and then cloning it to my local environment using GitBash. I then created a few folders to house the CSS and assets. I created an index.html / script.js / style.css file in gitbash using 'touch' and then began to work through the files. Coding in the JavaScript first, to create the code structure, and then once sufficiently built out, I proceeded to work on the HTML and CSS. With any new major features/changes to the the code I added (git add -A) the changes, committed the changes (git commit -m " ") and then pushed them up to my remote repo on GitHub (git push origin).
